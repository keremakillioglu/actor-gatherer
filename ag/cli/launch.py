"""Launchers: how a harness is started with the context manager set up in it,
for one run -- what `ag <harness> ...` runs.

ag knows a harness only from its entry in config.toml, which names its
launcher class and its adaptor class:

    [cli.harnesses.mine]
    launcher = "pkg.mine.launch:MineLauncher"     # a Launcher subclass, "module:Class"
    adaptor  = "pkg.mine.adaptor:MineAdaptor"     # Python "module:Class", or TypeScript "path.ts:Export"
    command  = ["mine"]                           # and the launcher's own settings

    class MineLauncher(Launcher):
        defaults = {"command": ["mine"], "env": {}}   # a setting the entry leaves out
        def launch(self, run: Run) -> Launch: ...

The launcher is imported from its entry at run time -- ag imports nothing of
a harness otherwise -- and given its settings (the entry over its
`defaults`), the home, and each run: the harness's arguments, the command,
the environment, the gatherer, and the adaptor, which it hands on to the
harness's setup. A launcher changes nothing the harness reads: what it adds
(a flag, a variable, a hook server) is for the run alone. Of the harness side
it knows its harness's setup and nothing else.

class Launcher(ABC):
    r"""One harness's launcher, built with its settings (its entry in config.toml over its
    `defaults`) and the context manager's home.

    `ag` calls `launch` with a `Run`: the harness's arguments, its command, the environment, the
    gatherer (`None` for one per session), the working directory, whether this is a dry run, and
    the adaptor named in the entry. `launch` returns the command and environment to run. A
    launcher may also implement `describe` (for `ag config`), and `status` and `stop` (for
    anything it keeps running, such as a proxy). It changes nothing the harness reads on disk:
    everything is passed for this run only, through flags or the environment.

    **A sketch**, for a harness that loads a plugin given by a flag:

    ```python
    from ag.cli.launch import Launch, Launcher


    class MyLauncher(Launcher):
        defaults = {"command": ["mine"], "env": {}}

        def launch(self, run):
            env = {**run.env, "AG_ADAPTOR": run.adaptor}          # the plugin loads the adaptor ag checked
            flags = ["--plugin", "/path/to/my_plugin"] + (["--ag-gatherer", run.gatherer] if run.gatherer else [])
            return Launch([*run.command, *flags, *run.args], env)
    ```

    **Registering the harness** in config.toml:

    ```toml
    [cli.harnesses.mine]
    launcher = "my_pkg.launch:MyLauncher"
    adaptor  = "my_pkg.adaptor:MyAdaptor"        # or "path/to/adaptor.ts:MyAdaptor"
    command  = ["mine"]
    ```

    Then `ag mine` runs it. Before every run, `ag` checks that the gatherer's policy accepts
    what the adaptor and the pollers output, and `ag --dry-run mine` shows the command it would
    run. A harness cannot be named after one of `ag`'s own commands.

    Working launchers: each shipped harness's, in `ag/integrations/harnesses/<name>/setup/launch.py`.
